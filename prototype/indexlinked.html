    <li>Eased interagency communication to allow federal agencies to more effectively use all available resources in counter terrorism efforts

In 2014, Obama stated, "our nation's defense depends in part on the fidelity of those entrusted with our nation's secrets. If any individual who objects to government policy can take it into their own hands to publicly disclose classified information, then we will not be able to keep our people safe, or conduct foreign policy." He objected to the "sensational" way the leaks were reported, saying the reporting often "shed more heat than light." He went on to assert that the disclosures had revealed "methods to our adversaries that could impact our operations."</p>
            <p class="responseText" id="protestsText">Snowden’s Disclosures have inspired public protests such as “Restore the Fourth”, “Stop Watching Us”, and “The Day We Fight Back”. “Restore the Fourth” held protests in over 80 cities. “Stop Watching Us” was held on October 26th, 2013 in Washington DC.  “The Day We Fight Back” was an internet campaign for websites to display a banner “The Day We Fight Back” for 24 hours on February 11th, 2014. The protest fell short with the major tech companies showing a small sign of support but not the full banner.            </p>

              <br><br>
              Reauthorization bills of the Patriot Act failed to pass congress and expired on June 1, 2015. Instead the next day the USA Freedom Act was passed reenacting the expired sections through 2019. However, Section 215 was amended to disallow the NSA to continue its mass phone data collection program. Instead, phone companies will retain the data and the NSA can obtain information about targeted individuals with a federal search warrant.

            <p class="responseText" id="publicText">Two years later, Last Week Tonight Show Host, John Oliver, said that we have forgotten how to have public debate around the issue of mass surveillance. He interviewed people on the street in Times Square about who Snowden was and none of them had any clue. <br><br> Americans were divided about the impact of the leaks immediately following Snowden’s disclosures, but a majority said the government should prosecute the leaker. About half of Americans (49%) said the release of the classified information served the public interest, while 44% said it harmed the public interest, according to <br> a <a class="inlinequote" target="blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2013/06/17/public-split-over-impact-of-nsa-leak-but-most-want-snowden-prosecuted/">Pew Research Center survey</a> conducted days <br>after the revelations.</p>
            <p class="responseText" id="globalText">International response to Snowden was initially more about asking the US to give information on the situation and of the surveillance of their respective citizens in the US. In Hong Kong, where Snowden was hiding, the government desired to handle the situation in an organized manner and not get involved with a mess. After Snowden left Hong Kong, Chinese media expressed relief that Hong Kong no longer had to deal with the burden of Snowden. </p>
