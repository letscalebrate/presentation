    <li>Eased interagency communication to allow federal agencies to more effectively use all available resources in counter terrorism efforts

    <h1>Snowden</h1> 
    <div class="textholder">
    <p><a class="inlinequote" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden" target="blank">Edward Snowden</a> was 29 years old at the time, technical assistant for the CIA and employee of the defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton. He had been working for the last four years as an employee of various outside contractors, including Booz Allen and Dell. </p>
    <p>After some time being employed, Snowden lost faith in those programs, resulting in Snowden trying to raise ethical concerns within these programs, but was ignored. In turn, his frustrations motivated him to fly to Hong Kong on May 20, 2013 after quitting his job. Once he arrived in Hong Kong, leaving his NSA Facility in Hawaii, he then leaked thousands of private and classified documents to the journalists from The Guardian and Washington Post. </p>
